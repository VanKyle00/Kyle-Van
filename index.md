# Kyle Van's Resume
## Carlsbad, California

### Summary

I started programming with Lua in video games in my early life. Throughout my further education, I continually explored new aspects of programming. I've worked with HTML and CSS to develop a rankings website. I worked with SQL to develop a backend for my website and also a backend for user-data for a private server. After exploring and dabbling in many fields, I discovered that I have a passion for infrastructure. This wide array of knowledge allows me to see the bigger picture and understand how technology impacts the whole business.
